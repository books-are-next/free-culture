title: Acknowledgments

This book is the product of a long and as yet unsuccessful
struggle that began when I read of Eric Eldred's war to keep
books free. Eldred's work helped launch a movement, the free
culture movement, and it is to him that this book is
dedicated.

I received guidance in various places from friends and
academics, including Glenn Brown, Peter DiCola, Jennifer Mnookin,
Richard Posner, Mark Rose, and Kathleen Sullivan. And I received
correction and guidance from many amazing students at Stanford
Law School and Stanford University. They included Andrew B. Coan,
John Eden, James P. Fellers, Christopher Guzelian, Erica
Goldberg, Robert Hallman, Andrew Harris, Matthew Kahn, Brian
Link, Ohad Mayblum, Alina Ng, and Erica Platt. I am particularly
grateful to Catherine Crump and Harry Surden, who helped direct
their research, and to Laura Lynch, who brilliantly managed the
army that they assembled, and provided her own critical eye on
much of this.

Yuko Noguchi helped me to understand the laws of Japan as well
as its culture. I am thankful to her, and to the many in Japan
who helped me prepare this book: Joi Ito, Takayuki Matsutani,
Naoto Misaki, Michihiro Sasaki, Hiromichi Tanaka, Hiroo Yamagata,
and Yoshihiro Yonezawa. I am thankful as well as to Professor
Nobuhiro Nakayama, and the Tokyo University Business Law Center,
for giving me the chance to spend time in Japan, and to Tadashi
Shiraishi and Kiyokazu Yamagami for their generous help while I
was there.

These are the traditional sorts of help that academics
regularly draw upon. But in addition to them, the Internet has
made it possible to receive advice and correction from many whom
I have never even met. Among those who have responded with
extremely helpful advice to requests on my blog about the book
are Dr. Mohammad Al-Ubaydli, David Gerstein, and Peter DiMauro,
as well as a long list of those who had specific ideas about ways
to develop my argument. They included Richard Bondi, Steven
Cherry, David Coe, Nik Cubrilovic, Bob Devine, Charles Eicher,
Thomas Guida, Elihu M. Gerson, Jeremy Hunsinger, Vaughn Iverson,
John Karabaic, Jeff Keltner, James Lindenschmidt, K. L. Mann,
Mark Manning, Nora McCauley, Jeffrey McHugh, Evan McMullen, Fred
Norton, John Pormann, Pedro A. D. Rezende, Shabbir Safdar, Saul
Schleimer, Clay Shirky, Adam Shostack, Kragen Sitaker, Chris
Smith, Bruce Steinberg, Andrzej Jan Taramina, Sean Walsh, Matt
Wasserman, Miljenko Williams, “Wink,” Roger Wood,
“Ximmbo da Jazz,” and Richard Yanco. (I apologize if
I have missed anyone; with computers come glitches, and a crash
of my e-mail system meant I lost a bunch of great replies.)

Richard Stallman and Michael Carroll each read the whole book
in draft, and each provided extremely helpful correction and
advice. Michael helped me to see more clearly the significance of
the regulation of derivitive works. And Richard corrected an
embarrassingly large number of errors. While my work is in part
inspired by Stallman's, he does not agree with me in important
places throughout this book.

Finally, and forever, I am thankful to Bettina, who has always
insisted that there would be unending happiness away from these
battles, and who has always been right. This slow learner is, as
ever, grateful for her perpetual patience and love.
