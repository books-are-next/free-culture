overwhelmingly primary purpose of the copyright established in
the federal constitution. State copyright law historically
protected not just the commercial interest in publication, but
also a privacy interest. By granting authors the exclusive right

to control the spread of facts about them. See Samuel D. Warren

labor toward a labor of creativity. His work, however, doesn't
directly address the legal conditions under which that creativity
is enabled or stifled. I certainly agree with him about the
importance and significance of this change, but I also believe
the conditions under which it will be enabled are much more
tenuous.

[^22]: Until 1976, copyright law granted an author the possibility
of two terms: an initial term and a renewal term. I have
calculated the “average” term by determining the
weighted average of total registrations for any particular year,
and the proportion renewing. Thus, if 100 copyrights are
registered in year 1, and only 15 are renewed, and the renewal
term is 28 years, then the average term is 32.2 years. For the
renewal data and other relevant data, see the Web site associated
with this book, available at link #6.

“[T]here might be a collective economic rationality that
would lead manga and anime artists to forgo bringing legal
actions for infringement. One hypothesis is that all manga
artists may be better off collectively if they set aside their

rights. This is essentially a prisoner's dilemma
solved.”

is very different.

Feudalism: Who Owns the Knowledge Economy?* (New York: The New

Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement obligates member
nations to create administrative and enforcement mechanisms for
intellectual property rights, a costly proposition for developing
countries. Additionally, patent rights may lead to higher prices
for staple industries such as agriculture. Critics of TRIPS
question the disparity between burdens imposed upon developing
countries and benefits conferred to industrialized nations. TRIPS
does permit governments to use patents for public, noncommercial
uses without first obtaining the patent holder's permission.
Developing nations may be able to use this to gain the benefits
of foreign patents at lower prices. This is a promising strategy
for developing nations within the TRIPS framework.

there are other cases as well. The technology of digital audio
tape (DAT), for example, was regulated by Congress to minimize
the risk of piracy. The remedy Congress imposed did burden DAT
producers, by taxing tape sales and controlling the technology of
DAT. See Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 (Title 17 of the

rights are intangible. A property right is simply a right that an
individual has against the world to do or not do certain things
that may or may not attach to a physical object. The right itself
is intangible, even if the object to which it is (metaphorically)
attached is tangible. See Adam Mossoff, “What Is Property?

[^119]: Lawyers speak of “property” not as an absolute
thing, but as a bundle of rights that are sometimes associated
with a particular object. Thus, my “property right”
to my car gives me the right to exclusive use, but not the right
to drive at 150 miles an hour. For the best effort to connect the
ordinary meaning of “property” to “lawyer
talk,” see Bruce Ackerman, *Private Property and the
Constitution* (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977),
26-27.

[^120]: By describing the way law affects the other three
modalities, I don't mean to suggest that the other three don't
affect law. Obviously, they do. Law's only distinction is that it
alone speaks as if it has a right self-consciously to change the
other three. The right of the other three is more timidly
expressed. See Lawrence Lessig, *Code: And Other Laws of
Cyberspace* (New <a name="p318"><u>York</u></a> : Basic Books, 1999): 90-95; Lawrence
Lessig, “The New Chicago School,” *Journal of Legal
Studies*, June 1998.

[^121]: Some people object to this way of talking about
“liberty.” They object because their focus when
considering the constraints that exist at any particular moment
are constraints imposed exclusively by the government. For
instance, if a storm destroys a bridge, these people think it is
meaningless to say that one's liberty has been restrained. A
bridge has washed out, and it's harder to get from one place to
another. To talk about this as a loss of freedom, they say, is to
confuse the stuff of politics with the vagaries of ordinary
life.

    I don't mean to deny the value in this narrower view, which
depends upon the context of the inquiry. I do, however, mean to
argue against any insistence that this narrower view is the only
proper view of liberty. As I argued in *Code*, we come from
a long tradition of political thought with a broader focus than
the narrow question of what the government did when. John Stuart
Mill defended freedom of speech, for example, from the tyranny of
narrow minds, not from the fear of government prosecution; John
Stuart Mill, *On Liberty* (Indiana: Hackett Publishing Co.,
1978), 19. John R. Commons famously defended the economic freedom
of labor from constraints imposed by the market; John R. Commons,
“The Right to Work,” in Malcom Rutherford and Warren
J. Samuels, eds., *John R. Commons: Selected Essays*
(London: Routledge: 1997), 62. The Americans with Disabilities
Act increases the liberty of people with physical disabilities by
changing the architecture of certain public places, thereby
making access to those places easier; 42 *United States
Code*, section 12101 (2000). Each of these interventions to
change existing conditions changes the liberty of a particular
group. The effect of those interventions should be accounted for
in order to understand the effective liberty that each of these
groups might face.

[^126]: Although 13,000 titles were published in the United States
from 1790 to <a name="p319"><u>1799</u></a> , only 556 copyright registrations were filed;
John Tebbel, *A History of Book Publishing in the United
States*, vol. 1, *The Creation of an Industry, 1630-1865*
(New York: Bowker, 1972), 141. Of the 21,000 imprints recorded
before 1790, only twelve were copyrighted under the 1790 act;
William J. Maher, *Copyright Term, Retrospective Extension and
the Copyright Law of 1790 in Historical Context*, 7-10 (2002),
available at link #25. Thus, the overwhelming majority of works
fell immediately into the public domain. Even those works that
were copyrighted fell into the public domain quickly, because the
term of copyright was short. The initial term of copyright was
fourteen years, with the option of renewal for an additional
fourteen years. Copyright Act of May 31, 1790, §1, 1 stat.
124.

[^127]: Few copyright holders ever chose to renew their
copyrights. For instance, of the 25,006 copyrights registered in
1883, only 894 were renewed in 1910. For a year-by-year analysis
of copyright renewal rates, see Barbara A. Ringer, “Study
No. 31: Renewal of Copyright,” *Studies on Copyright*,
vol. 1 (New York: Practicing Law Institute, 1963), 618. For a

[^129]: These statistics are understated. Between the years 1910
and 1962 (the first year the renewal term was extended), the
average term was never more than thirty-two years, and averaged
thirty years. See Landes and Posner, “Indefinitely

[^132]: Professor Rubenfeld has presented a powerful
constitutional argument about the difference that copyright law
should draw (from the perspective of the First Amendment) between
mere “copies” and derivative works. See Jed
Rubenfeld, “The Freedom of Imagination: Copyright's
Constitutionality,” *Yale Law Journal* 112 (2002):
1-60 (see especially pp. 53-59).

[^133]: This is a simplification of the law, but not much of one.
The law certainly regulates more than
“copies”—a public performance of a copyrighted
song, for example, is regulated even though performance per se
doesn't make a copy; 17 *United States Code*, section
106(4). And it certainly sometimes doesn't regulate a
“copy”; 17 *United States Code*, section 112(a).
But the presumption under the existing law (which regulates
“copies;” 17 *United States Code*, section 102)
is that if there is a copy, there is a right.

[^134]: Thus, my argument is not that in each place that copyright
law extends, <a name="p320"><u>we</u></a>  should repeal it. It is instead that we should
have a good argument for its extending where it does, and should
not determine its reach on the basis of arbitrary and automatic
changes caused by technology.

[^135]: I don't mean “nature” in the sense that it
couldn't be different, but rather that its present instantiation
entails a copy. Optical networks need not make copies of content
they transmit, and a digital network could be designed to delete
anything it copies so that the same number of copies remain.

contract, not from copyright law, and the obligations of contract
would not necessarily pass to anyone who subsequently acquired
the book.

place ads that directly responded to the Nick and Norm series on
stations within the Washington, D.C., area. Comcast rejected the
ads as “against [their] policy.” The local NBC
affiliate, WRC, rejected the ads without reviewing them. The
local ABC affiliate, WJOA, originally agreed to run the ads and
accepted payment to do so, but later decided not to run the ads
and returned the collected fees. Interview with Neal Levine, 15

    These restrictions are, of course, not limited to drug policy.
See, for example, Nat Ives, “On the Issue of an Iraq War,
Advocacy Ads Meet with Rejection from TV Networks,” *New

air time there is very little that the FCC or the courts are
willing to do to even the playing field. For a general overview,
see Rhonda Brown, “Ad Hoc Access: The Regulation of

summary of the stance of the FCC and the courts, see
*Radio-Television News Directors Association* v. *FCC*,
184 F. 3d 872 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Municipal authorities exercise
the same authority as the networks. In a recent example from San
Francisco, the San Francisco transit authority rejected an ad
that criticized its Muni diesel buses. Phillip Matier and Andrew
Ross, “Antidiesel Group Fuming After Muni Rejects
Ad,” SFGate.com, 16 June 2003, available at link #32. The

Reps. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Howard L. Berman (D-Calif.)
have introduced a bill that would treat unauthorized on-line
copying as a felony offense with punishments ranging as high as
five years imprisonment; see Jon Healey, “House Bill Aims
to Up Stakes on Piracy,” *Los Angeles Times*, 17 July
2003, available at link #34. Civil penalties are currently set at
$150,000 per copied song. For a recent (and unsuccessful) legal
challenge to the RIAA's demand that an ISP reveal the identity of
a user accused of sharing more than 600 songs through a family
computer, see *RIAA* v. *Verizon Internet Services (In re.
Verizon Internet Services)*, 240 F. Supp. 2d 24 (D.D.C. 2003).
Such a user could face liability ranging as high as $90 million.
Such astronomical figures furnish the RIAA with a powerful
arsenal in its prosecution of file sharers. Settlements ranging
from $12,000 to $17,500 for four students accused of heavy file
sharing on university networks must have seemed a mere pittance
next to the $98 billion the RIAA could seek should the matter
proceed to court. See Elizabeth Young, “Downloading Could

Industry Association of America (RIAA)* v. *Diamond
Multimedia Systems*, 180 F. 3d 1072 (9th Cir. 1999). There the
court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit reasoned that makers of a
portable MP3 player were not liable for contributory copyright
infringement for a device that is unable to record or
redistribute music (a device whose only copying function is to
render portable a music file already stored on a user's hard
drive).

    At the district court level, the only exception is found in
*Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc*. v. *Grokster,
Ltd*., 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029 (C.D. Cal., 2003), where the court
found the link between the distributor and any given user's
conduct too attenuated to make the distributor liable for
contributory or vicarious infringement liability.

[^167]: For example, in July 2002, Representative Howard Berman
introduced the Peer-to-Peer Piracy Prevention Act (H.R. 5211),
which would immunize copyright holders from liability for damage
done to computers when the copyright holders use technology to
stop copyright infringement. In August 2002, Representative Billy
Tauzin introduced a bill to mandate that technologies capable of
rebroadcasting digital copies of films broadcast on TV (i.e.,
computers) respect a “broadcast flag” that would
disable copying of that content. And in March of the same year,
Senator Fritz Hollings introduced the Consumer Broadband and
Digital Television Promotion Act, which mandated copyright
protection technology in all digital media devices. See

[^179]: There's a parallel here with pornography that is a bit hard
to describe, but it's a strong one. One phenomenon that the
Internet created was a world of noncommercial
pornographers—people who were distributing porn but were
not making money directly or indirectly from that distribution.
Such a class didn't exist before the Internet came into being
because the costs of distributing porn were so high. Yet this new
class of distributors got special attention in the Supreme Court,
when the Court struck down the Communications Decency Act of
1996. It was partly because of the burden on noncommercial
speakers that the statute was found to exceed Congress's power.
The same point could have been made about noncommercial
publishers after the advent of the Internet. The Eric Eldreds of
the world before the Internet were extremely few. Yet one would
think it at least as important to protect the Eldreds of the
world as to protect noncommercial pornographers.

[^186]: If it is a principle about enumerated powers, then the
principle carries from one enumerated power to another. The
animating point in the context of the Commerce Clause was that
the interpretation offered by the government would allow the
government unending power to regulate commerce—the
limitation to interstate commerce notwithstanding. The same point
is true in the context of the Copyright Clause. Here, too, the
government's interpretation would allow the government unending
power to regulate copyrights—the limitation to
“limited times” notwithstanding.

[^194]: Until the 1908 Berlin Act of the Berne Convention, national
copyright legislation sometimes made protection depend upon
compliance with formalities such as registration, deposit, and
affixation of notice of the author’s claim of copyright. However,
starting with the 1908 act, every text of the Convention has
provided that “the enjoyment and the exercise” of
rights guaranteed by the Convention “shall not be subject
to any formality.” The prohibition against formalities is
presently embodied in Article 5(2) of the Paris Text of the Berne
Convention. Many countries continue to impose some form of
deposit or registration requirement, albeit not as a condition of
copyright. French law, for example, requires the deposit of
copies of works in national repositories, principally the
National Museum. Copies of books published in the United Kingdom
must be deposited in the British Library. The German Copyright
Act provides for a Registrar of Authors where the author's true
name can be filed in the case of anonymous or pseudonymous works.

[^202]: Microsoft's position about free and open source software is
more sophisticated. As it has repeatedly asserted, it has no
problem with “open source” software or software in
the public domain. Microsoft's principal opposition is to
“free software” licensed under a “copyleft”
license, meaning a license that requires the licensee to adopt
the same terms on any derivative work. See Bradford L. Smith,

Professor Netanel has proposed a related idea that would exempt
noncommercial sharing from the reach of copyright and would
establish compensation to artists to balance any loss. See Neil
Weinstock Netanel, “Impose a Noncommercial Use Levy to
Allow Free P2P File Sharing,” available at link <a name="p330"><u>#79</u></a>.  For
other proposals, see Lawrence Lessig, “Who's Holding Back
Broadband?” *Washington Post*, 8 January 2002, A17;

Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Chairman of the Senate Foreign

    Fisher's proposal is very similar to Richard Stallman's
proposal for DAT. Unlike Fisher's, Stallman's proposal would not
pay artists directly proportionally, though more popular artists
would get more than the less popular. As is typical with
Stallman, his proposal predates the current debate by about a
decade. See link #85.

[^222]: A good example is the work of Professor Stan Liebowitz.
Liebowitz is to be commended for his careful review of data about
infringement, leading him to question his own publicly stated
position—twice. He initially predicted that downloading
would substantially harm the industry. He then revised his view
in light of the data, and he has since revised his view again.
Compare Stan J. Liebowitz, *Rethinking the Network Economy: The 
True Forces That Drive the Digital Marketplace* (New York:
Amacom, 2002), 173 (reviewing his original view but expressing
skepticism) with Stan J. Liebowitz, “Will MP3s Annihilate
the Record Industry?” working paper, June 2003, available
at link #86.

    Liebowitz's careful analysis is extremely valuable in
estimating the effect of file-sharing technology. In my view,
however, he underestimates the costs of the legal system. See,
for example, *Rethinking*, 174-76.
